For example, drop support trendline by low prices of bars.

In each iteration:
1. if all points are lined up in sequence - for true, complete
2. else, check if only two points - for true, complete
3. else, check if only three points - see three points
4. else:
-- keep only low points, which are lower than both previous or next point.
---- for the first point, it compares only to the next point
---- for the last point, it compares only to the previous point

three points:
in this case, the the points for sure not lined up in sequence.
- if middle point is high, continue to iterate
- if middle point is low
--- check if the middle point has many bars (like >50%) away from the first or last bar
----- if true, keep only the middle point and the far away bar.
----- if no such result, return null

After iteration

- if only two points
--- if the two points are too close - return null
--- else: return the time and price of the two points
- else (more than two points lined up in order):
--- can use linear regression
--- alternatively, use mean and std to filter out outliers, then return the first and last point
